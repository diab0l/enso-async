# Enso.Aff
The purpose of this repository is to prototype asynchronous programming in enso.

Asynchronous computations are modelled as the Asynchronous Effect Monad (called Aff) analogous to purescript-aff and LanguageExt.Aff.

Examples of asynchronous effects are:
- Reading a file
- Writing to a file
- Waiting for some time
- Fetching from a web resource
